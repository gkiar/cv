    abstract = {Modern scientific discovery depends on collecting large heterogeneous datasets with many sources of variability, and on applying domain-specific pipelines from which one can draw scientific insight or clinical utility. For example, macroscale connectomics studies require complex pipelines to process raw functional or diffusion data and estimate connectomes. Individual studies tend to customize pipelines to their needs, raising concerns about their reproducibility, which add to a longer list of factors that may differ across studies and result in failures to replicate (including sampling, experimental design, and data acquisition protocols). Mitigating these issues requires the development of pipelines that can be applied across multiple studies. We developed NeuroData{\textquoteright}s MRI to Graphs (ndmg) pipeline using several functional and diffusion studies to estimate connectomes. Without any manual intervention or parameter tuning, ndmg ran on nearly 30 different studies (nearly 6,000 scans), with each scan resulting in a biologically plausible connectome (as assessed by multiple quality assurance metrics at each processing stage). For each study, the connectomes from ndmg are more similar within than across individuals, indicating that ndmg is preserving biological variability. Moreover, the connectomes exhibit near perfect consistency for certain connectional properties across every scan, individual, study, site and modality; these include stronger ipsilateral than contralateral connections and stronger homotopic than heterotopic connections. Yet, how much stronger varied across individuals and studies {\textemdash} much more so when pooling data across sites, even after controlling for study, site, and basic demographic variables (i.e., age, sex, and ethnicity). This indicates that other experimental variables (possibly those not measured or reported) are contributing to this variability, which if not accounted for can limit the value of aggregate datasets, as well as expectations regarding the accuracy of findings and likelihood of replication. We thus provide a set of principles to guide the development of pipelines capable of pooling data across studies while maintaining biological variability and minimizing measurement error. This open science approach provides us with an opportunity to understand and eventually mitigate spurious results for both past and future studies.},

We have endeavored to design our hackathon events such that existing open-source software projects receive attention and support from experienced users while new adopters can gain familiarity with these tools. However, we have received community feedback that our events are still perceived as exclusionary to code-nervous researchers, and we have had difficulty quantifying overall outcomes to assess how to make improvements. We are applying to the CHI workshop with the hope of learning how to better design and organize our events to be more inclusive, and provide concrete evidence upon which we can advertise the successes of OHBM hackathon events and continuously improve.}
