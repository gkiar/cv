  abstract = "The cost of data collection and processing is becoming
              prohibitively expensive for many research groups across
              disciplines, a problem that is exacerbated by the dependence of
              ever larger sample sizes to obtain reliable inferences for
              increasingly subtle questions. And yet, as more data is available
              and open access, more researchers desire to analyze it for
              different questions, often including previously unforeseen
              questions. To further increase sample sizes, existing datasets
              are often amalgamated. These reference datasets - datasets that
              serve to answer many disparate questions for different
              individuals - are increasingly common and important. Reference
              pipelines efficiently and flexibly analyze on all the datasets.
              How can one optimally design these reference datasets and
              pipelines to yield derivative data that are simultaneously useful
              for many different tasks? We propose an approach to experimental
              design that leverages multiple measurements for each distinct
              item (for example, an individual). The key insight is that each
              measurement of the same item should be more similar to other
              measurements of that item, as compared to measurements of any
              other item. In other words, we seek to optimally discriminate one
              item from another. We formalize the notion of discriminability,
              and introduce both a non-parameteric and parametric statistic to
              quantify the discriminability of potentially multivariate or
              non-Euclidean datasets. With this notion, one can make optimal
              decisions - either with regard to acquisition or analysis of data
              - by maximizing discriminability. Crucially, this optimization
              can be performed in the absence of any task-specific (or
              supervised) information. We show that optimizing decisions with
              respect to discriminability yields improved performance on
              subsequent inference tasks. We apply this strategy to a brain
              imaging dataset built by the ``Consortium for Reliability and
              Reproducability'' which consists of 24 disparate magnetic
              resonance imaging datasets, each with up to hundreds of
              individuals that were imaged multiple times. We show that by
              optimizing pipelines with respect to discriminability, we improve
              performance on multiple subsequent inference tasks, even though
              discriminability does not consider the tasks whatsoever.",

  abstract      = "A lack of software reproducibility has become increasingly
                   apparent in the last several years, calling into question
                   the validity of scientific findings affected by published
                   tools. Reproducibility issues may have numerous sources of
                   error, including the underlying numerical stability of
                   algorithms and implementations employed. Various forms of
                   instability have been observed in neuroimaging, including
                   across operating system versions, minor noise injections,
                   and implementation of theoretically equivalent algorithms.
                   In this paper we explore the effect of various perturbation
                   methods on a typical neuroimaging pipeline through the use
                   of i) near-epsilon noise injections, ii) Monte Carlo
                   Arithmetic, and iii) varying operating systems to identify
                   the quality and severity of their impact. The work presented
                   here demonstrates that even low order computational models
                   such as the connectome estimation pipeline that we used are
                   susceptible to noise. This suggests that stability is a
                   relevant axis upon which tools should be compared,
                   developed, or improved, alongside more commonly considered
                   axes such as accuracy/biological feasibility or performance.
                   The heterogeneity observed across participants clearly
                   illustrates that stability is a property of not just the
                   data or tools independently, but their interaction.
                   Characterization of stability should therefore be evaluated
                   for specific analyses and performed on a representative set
                   of subjects for consideration in subsequent statistical
                   testing. Additionally, identifying how this relationship
                   scales to higher-order models is an exciting next step which
                   will be explored. Finally, the joint application of
                   perturbation methods with post-processing approaches such as
                   bagging or signal normalization may lead to the development
                   of more numerically stable analyses while maintaining
                   sensitivity to meaningful variation.",

  abstract = "Accurate prediction of individuals' brain age is critical to
              establish a baseline for normal brain development. This study
              proposes to model brain development with a novel non-negative
              projective dictionary learning (NPDL) approach, which learns a
              discriminative representation of multi-modal neuroimaging data
              for predicting brain age. Our approach encodes the variability of
              subjects in different age groups using separate dictionaries,
              projecting features into a low-dimensional manifold such that
              information is preserved only for the corresponding age group.
              The proposed framework improves upon previous discriminative
              dictionary learning methods by incorporating orthogonality and
              non-negativity constraints, which remove representation
              redundancy and perform implicit feature selection. We study brain
              development on multi-modal brain imaging data from the PING
              dataset (N = 841, age = 3-21 years). The proposed analysis uses
              our NDPL framework to predict the age of subjects based on
              cortical measures from T1-weighted MRI and connectome from
              diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). We also investigate the
              association between age prediction and cognition, and study the
              influence of gender on prediction accuracy. Experimental results
              demonstrate the usefulness of NDPL for modeling brain
              development.",

abstract={Neuroscience has been carried into the domain of big data and high performance computing (HPC) on the backs of initiatives in data collection and an increasingly compute-intensive tools. While managing HPC experiments requires considerable technical acumen, platforms and standards have been developed to ease this burden on scientists. While web-portals make resources widely accessible, data organizations such as the Brain Imaging Data Structure and tool description languages such as Boutiques provide researchers with a foothold to tackle these problems using their own datasets, pipelines, and environments. While these standards lower the barrier to adoption of HPC and cloud systems for neuroscience applications, they still require the consolidation of disparate domain-specific knowledge. We present Clowdr, a lightweight tool to launch experiments on HPC systems and clouds, record rich execution records, and enable the accessible sharing and re-launch of experimental summaries and results. Clowdr uniquely sits between web platforms and bare-metal applications for experiment management by preserving the flexibility of do-it-yourself solutions while providing a low barrier for developing, deploying and disseminating neuroscientific analysis.}

However, we have received community feedback that our events are still perceived as exclusionary to code-nervous researchers, and we have had difficulty quantifying overall outcomes to assess how to make improvements.
